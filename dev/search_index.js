In 1973, Black and Scholes transformed their formula on option pricing and corporate liabilities into a PDE model, which is widely used in financing engineering for computing the option price over time. [1.] In this example we will solve a Black-Scholes-Barenblatt equation of 100 dimensions. The Black-Scholes-Barenblatt equation is a nonlinear extension to the Black-Scholes equation which models uncertain volatility and interest rates derived from the Black-Scholes equation. This model results in a nonlinear PDE whose dimension is the number of assets in the portfolio.","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/blackscholes/#","page":"Solving the 100 dimensional Black-Scholes-Barenblatt Equation","title":"Solving the 100 dimensional Black-Scholes-Barenblatt Equation","text":"To solve it using the TerminalPDEProblem, we write:","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/blackscholes/#","page":"Solving the 100 dimensional Black-Scholes-Barenblatt Equation","title":"Solving the 100 dimensional Black-Scholes-Barenblatt Equation","text":"d = 100 # number of dimensions\nX0 = repeat([1.0f0, 0.5f0], div(d,2)) # initial value of stochastic state\ntspan = (0.0f0,1.0f0)\nr = 0.05f0\nsigma = 0.4f0\nf(X,u,σᵀ∇u,p,t) = r * (u - sum(X.*σᵀ∇u))\ng(X) = sum(X.^2)\nμ_f(X,p,t) = zero(X) #Vector d x 1\nσ_f(X,p,t) = Diagonal(sigma*X) #Matrix d x d\nprob = TerminalPDEProblem(g, f, μ_f, σ_f, X0, tspan)","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/blackscholes/#","page":"Solving the 100 dimensional Black-Scholes-Barenblatt Equation","title":"Solving the 100 dimensional Black-Scholes-Barenblatt Equation","text":"As described in the API docs, we now need to define our NNPDENS algorithm by giving it the Flux.jl chains we want it to use for the neural networks. u0 needs to be a d dimensional -> 1 dimensional chain, while σᵀ∇u needs to be d+1 dimensional to d dimensions.
